Konggo
======
A kong go client fully tested with no mocks!!

## Kong go
Kong go is a easy to use api client for [kong](https://getkong.org/).  The difference with the konggo library is all of its tests are written against a real running kong running inside a docker container, yep that's right you won't see a horrible mock anywhere!!  

## Running tests
To run the integration tests
`make test`

## Run build
`make`
